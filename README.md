# SPFSteamroller

A No-Bullshit SPF Flattening tool that helps you deal with those annoyingly long SPF records! Without paying Monthly Cash for it like 100 of Websites out there want you to.

I went through the headace for you, so you can do it for free.
Maybe shoot me a donation if I was helpful.

## What it Does
Ever had an SPF record that's just too long or has way too many DNS lookups? SPFSteamroller takes care of that by:
- Flattening your SPF record into pure IP addresses and CIDR ranges
- Splitting it into multiple records if it gets too long
- Optionally pushing everything directly to Cloudflare

## How to Use It

### First Time Setup
1. Just run the tool once - it'll create a `config.ini` file for you
2. Open up the config file and fill in your details:
   ```ini
   [Cloudflare]
   email=your@email.com
   apiKey=your-api-key-here
   zoneId=your-zone-id
   domain=yourdomain.com
   updateCloudflare=true/false
   ```
3. Create a TXT record at `_masterspf.yourdomain.com` with your full SPF record
   - This is your "master" SPF where you'll make all future changes
   - Put everything in here, no matter how messy it is!

### Running the Tool
Just run the executable! It will:
1. Read your master SPF record
2. Flatten everything into pure IPs and networks
3. Create nice, clean SPF records
4. Either:
   - Save them to `output.txt` (if `updateCloudflare=false`)
   - Or automatically update your Cloudflare DNS (if `updateCloudflare=true`)

### Want to Make Changes?
1. Update your master SPF record at `_masterspf.yourdomain.com`
2. Run the tool again
3. That's it! ðŸŽ‰

## How it Works (The Fun Version)
1. It grabs your messy SPF record and says "let me clean that up for you"
2. Follows all your includes, looks up all your A/AAAA/MX records
3. Turns everything into a nice list of IP addresses and networks
4. If the result is too long (because DNS has limits, you know), it splits it into chunks
   - Creates records like `_spf1.yourdomain.com`, `_spf2.yourdomain.com`, etc.
   - Links them together with includes
   - Makes sure your main domain points to the first one

## Need to Restore a Backup?
The tool creates backups of your SPF records before making changes. To restore simply run with the `-RestoreBackup <Path to Backup>` Switch
